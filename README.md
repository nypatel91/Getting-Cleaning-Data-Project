# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Project

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Load 3 datasets, i.e. readings, activity labels and subject data from working directory
Filter readings dataset based on variables wanted, i.e. mean and standard deviation of different parameters only
Merges the three datasets
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
